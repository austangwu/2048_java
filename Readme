Readme for Austin Wu's version of 2048 in Java.
This is a version of the popular number tile game 2048 written in the Java programming language.
This project was started in early June and finished on June 14th.
This project borrows code from another of my projects, a Tetris game written in Java. It uses
the same block based GUI to store information in the game.
